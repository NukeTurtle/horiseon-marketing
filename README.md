# Horiseon Marketing and SEO

## Description 

A client, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, my tech lead has given me a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project.

The page features:
- a header with logo and links
- hero image
- two separate sections in the main section of the page (left/right)
- left sections shows three services the business offers
- right side shows three types of benefits
